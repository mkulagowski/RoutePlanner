# RoutePlanner
Have You ever planned a trip abroad to a town, You've never seen before?
<br>
Imagine You have lots of places to visit, yet no idea HOW to visit them...
<br>
<br>
...**RoutePlanner** can lend You a helping hand!
It gets travel times between given addresses via public transport from GoogleMaps API, finds the shortest (more or less) route and then prints directions.
<br>
Maybe in some distant future it will show a map with given points & drawn lines...

For now it's mainly a mean of having fun with GoogleMaps API.

## How to use:
In order to launch **RoutePlanner**, You'll need googlemaps python lib available [**HERE**](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python/), installed as 'googlemaps' (as stated in their readme file).
