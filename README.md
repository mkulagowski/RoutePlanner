# RoutePlanner
Have You ever planned a trip abroad to a town, You've never seen before?
Imagine You have lots of places to visit, yet no idea HOW to visit them...

...RoutePlanner can lend You a helping hand!
It gets travel times between given addresses via public transport from GoogleMaps API, then finds the shortest (more or less) route.
Maybe in some distant future it will show map with given points & drawn lines...or maybe it will print instructions on how to travel.

For now it's mainly a mean of having fun with GoogleMaps API.
